Q In a famous 17th-century experiment, researchers put eight similar pieces of meat into eight identical jars.  Four of the jars were sealed, and four were left open to the air.  Maggots grew on the meat in open jars, but not in the sealed jars.  Which of the following hypotheses are consistent with this experimental result?  You should answer this question _without_ taking into account knowledge you may have from other experiments.

Maggots are spontaneously generated by rotten meat, and can grow with or without air.

Maggots are spontaneously generated by rotten meat, but cannot grow without air.

Maggots result from microscopic fly eggs; flies must have access to the meat for maggots to grow.

A and C are both consistent with this experiment.

* B and C are both consistent with this experiment.

Q In the experiment above, why did the researchers use four jars of each type?

To make sure there was enough meat to attract flies.

As a control, to make sure that the two treatments differed as little as possible.

* To reduce the likelihood of accidental results.

To make efficient use of laboratory equipment.

Q A population of Staphylococcus bacteria is exposed to a drug treatment. Some of the bacteria have a ``persistence'' allele that allows them to halt metabolic processes when drug concentrations are high, and resume normal life when concentrations drop. Bacteria without the allele die when drug concentrations are high. If the population is exposed to treatment for a long time, we expect that natural selection on the persistence allele:

* will occur, because all of the logical conditions are met

will not occur, because there is no variation in traits

will not occur, because variation in traits is not heritable

will not occur, because there is no variation in reproductive success

STARTSA

MARK  Feel free to deduct if answers are long and contain irrelevant or (especially) wrong stuff along with the right stuff.

Q (6 marks in total) An eye-color locus is studied in a population of owls.  Two alleles are found: L is associated with lighter-coloured eyes, and D is associated with darker-coloured eyes.  The study finds that 30% of individuals sampled have genotype LL, 20% have genotype LD, and 50% have genotype DD.

SQ What is the frequency of each of the alleles? (2 marks)

STANS The alleles are L and D. $F(L) = 0.3 + 0.2/2 = 0.4$.  $F(D) = 0.5 + 0.2/2 = 0.6$. 

MARK Full credit for right answer only. Partial credit if logic is clear but with dumb mistakes.

SQ Based on the allele frequencies calculated above, what genotype frequencies would be expected under the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions? (2 marks)

STANS The genotypes are LL, LD and DD. There are two ways to make LD (since it's the same as DL). The expected frequencies if everything is random are $F(LL) = F(L)^2 = 0.16$; $F(LD) = 2F(L)F(D) = 0.48$; $F(DD) = F(D)^2 = 0.36$; We check that these add to 1.

MARK As above

SQ How do the observed frequencies differ from the expected frequencies you calculated? (1 mark)

STANS The observed frequencies show more homozygotes and less heterozygotes in each of the three genotypes (we expect the three genotypes to agree on what there is more and less of).

MARK Full credit for ``more homozygotes than expected'' (or less heterozygotes). 

SQ Assuming this difference is not due to random chance, what is a likely explanation of the difference? (1 mark)

STANS Either non-random mating, or disruptive selection.

MARK No points for heterozygote advantage or balancing selection (unless it's clearly consistent with wrong answers above; don't take off twice for the same mistake).

Q (5 marks in total) You are studying a new clade of insects. You believe that the common ancestor could fly, had no stinger and could not digest raspberry leaves. Species A and B can both fly, species B and C can both digest raspberry leaves, and all three species have stingers. 

SQ For each characteristic, _explain_ whether it provides at least some information that would inform a cladistic tree. (3 marks)

STANS Flying provides no information, because only one species has the derived trait (of not being able to fly). Digesting does provide information, because it is a derived trait shared between B and C. Stingers provide no information because all three species are the same.

RUB One point for each trait. Half point for correct yes/no answer without a reasonable explanation.

SQ Which of these characteristics would you interpret differently in a phenetic framework and why? (1 mark)

STANS In a phenetic framework, the fact that two of the species can fly would be considered a similarity, so we would think that flight provided information. This is how we would think if we weren't sure that the relevant common ancestor could fly.

RUB Half a point for picking the trait, and half a point for a reasonable explanation

SQ Based on all the data above, and assuming you are confident about the characteristics of the ancestor, draw a tree showing the phylogenetic relationship you would infer between A, B and C.  (1 mark)

STANS If we are confident about the ancestor, we should use the cladistic approach. Thus, we would group B and C based on the fact they can digest raspberry leaves.

MARK Full marks for any clear indication that B is grouped with C.

Q (4 marks) List two possible results when related populations that have been separated reunite. Explain in one or two short sentences why this might happen and how you might determine how many species the new population or populations represent. Do not give more than two results, and do not write more than two short sentences.

STANS _Fusion_: if differences are small, or gene flow is strong, the populations might come back together into a single population. This would represent one species. _Reinforcement_: if hybrids have low fitness, natural selection may lead to barriers to reproduction. This would represent two species. _Hybrid zones_: the populations may remain separate but have an area where they mix, leading to gene flow. Most people would consider this a single species, but not everyone and not all the time; it could be two. _Exclusion_: one population may out-compete the other one, leaving only one species at the end. _New species_: hybrids may develop reinforcement and form their own species which may or may not out-compete one or both of the ``parents''. This could lead to one, two or three species at the end.

MARK Decide how much you will mark before even reading (up to two points; up to two short sentences per point). Be generous about ``short sentences'', but not ridiculously so.
