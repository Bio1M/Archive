easily available food that contains toxins vs. rare, toxin-free food

abundant, low-energy resource vs. rare, high-energy resource

* proximal vs ultimate mechanisms

nearby foraging sites with high competition vs far away foraging sites with low competition

Q In an environment where 75% of the available food items are insects and 25% are fruits, an organism is observed to eat a diet that is 50% insects and 50% fruit. This represents:

lack of food preference, because they are eating a balanced diet

a food desert

* food preference, because they are eating items _out of proportion_ to their availability in their environment

food preference, because they are eating items _in proportion_ to their availability in their environment

foraging tradeoffs

Q What is the main prediction of central place foraging theory?

organisms experience tradeoffs in foraging

organisms will balance risk of mortality against energy gain

organisms will balance search time against handling time

organisms will balance energy content against toxin content

consume your preferred prey, but still eat some of the less-preferred prey

* consume _only_ your preferred prey

eat preferred prey in proportion to their availability in the environment


Q Which of the following organisms would be classified as a _searcher_, rather than a _handler_?

a sloth that eats leaves from forest trees

a python that spends one week digesting each large prey time

a lion that is surrounded by ungulates (hoofed mammals) that are all potential prey

* a pollinator that specializes on a rare species of flower

a blue whale that strains krill from the ocean as it swims along

Q we run an experiment where we put both seeds (food items) and wolf scat (i.e. poop; an indicator of predator activity) in the vicinity of mouse burrows. Which of the following best describes our expectations about the change in mouse activity?

it will increase, because more seeds are available

it will increase, because mice don't have to forage as long to gather the same number of seeds

* it's hard to tell; it depends on how mice balance the risk of mortality and the reward of foraging

it will increase, because the risk of predation is higher

it will decrease, because the risk of predation is higher

Q why do biologists find it hard to believe that organisms would act to decrease their own fitness in order to increase another's, without some sort of indirect or future benefit?

because organisms usually live in groups with closely related individuals

* because we would expect the altruistic strategy to be out-evolved by cheaters

because there are always tradeoffs in nature

because most organisms are not capable of recognizing each other

because most examples of "altruism" turn out to be selfish when we evaluate them carefully

Q \emph{According to Hamilton's rule}, which of the following is most likely to increase the likelihood of cooperation?

living in the same place and interacting frequently

* low fitness costs to the individual donating the benefit

Q Which of the following statements best explains why (maternal) half-siblings are considered to be 25% related (according to Dr. Bolker, not the textbook!)?

* because there is a 25% chance that they will share any particular allele

because they share 50% of their genome through their maternal relationship

they are not 25% related, they are 50% related

because they always inherit identical alleles from their mother

because they never inherit identical alleles from their father

Q why do biologists think that Belding's ground squirrels have evolved to maximize their inclusive fitness?

because individuals generally behave in a friendly way to all nearby conspecifics

because alarm calls are risky

because individuals only alarm-call when their offspring are nearby

* because individuals are more likely to alarm-call more frequently when their offspring or other relatives are nearby

because ground squirrels live in spatially restricted environments, so they will frequently interact with the same individuals

Q why does interacting frequently with the same individuals, regardless of their relatedness to you, tend to favour cooperation?

because of inclusive fitness

it doesn't; cooperation only occurs between relatives

because cheaters generally do better in a spatially restricted environment

because both individuals need to cooperate in order for either of them to survive

* because it encourages strategies that reward past cooperation and punish past cheating

Q why do we think that the environment of evolutionary adaptation may have selected humans to be cooperative?

low-cost behaviours like sharing food were advantageous

humans lived in groups with their close relatives

humans lived in groups where they interacted with the same individuals repeatedly

Q In a simple world where the assumptions of this model are true, what kind of population dynamics would we expect?

exponential growth of both predators and prey

logistic growth

Q Why do we think that experiments that treated nematode parasites in red grouse gave a clearer result (stopping population cycles in treated plots) than experiments with lynx and hares (population cycles stopped partly in hare-food plots, only completely when lynx were excluded /and/ hares received extra food)?

nematode parasites are fundamentally different types of organisms from lynx predators

* red grouse live in a simpler ecological community than lynx and hares

hare population growth is not limited by food availability

the red grouse experiments were done on a much smaller spatial scale than the lynx-hare experiments

environmental factors such as weather are much more stable in red grouse than in lynx-hare habitats

Q In general, what are the relative sizes of an organism's fundamental and realized niches?

* fundamental larger than realized

they are the same size

fundamental smaller than realized

it depends on the presence of predators in the environment

it's unpredictable

Q A chickadee and a sparrow species that live in the same general habitat (deciduous forest) are never found nesting in the same tree. In order to determine whether the chickadee's niche is limited by environmental or competitive factors, we do an experiment where we remove sparrow nests from a large number of trees and see whether those trees are now colonized by chickadees. The outcome of the experiment is that _none_ of the experimental trees are colonized. The most reasonable conclusion is:

the fundamental niches of sparrows and chickadees overlap

chickadees' realized niche is partly determined by competition with sparrows

sparrows' realized niche is partly determined by competition with chickadees

chickadees' fundamental niche is partly determined by competition with sparrows

* chickadee nesting is not sensitive to competition with sparrows

Q Children of alcoholics are more likely to be alcohol-dependent.  Which of the following statements is _not_ true?

* alcohol dependence is a Mendelian trait

alcohol dependence is a quantitative trait

_Homo sapiens_ made _hafted_ tools (shaped stones attached to handles); Neanderthals didn't

* tool use by Neanderthals and early _Homo sapiens_ was fairly similar

Q Which of the following is _not_ an adaptation that contributed in some way to the evolution of humans from early hominins?

* stereoscopic vision

reduced jaw muscles

increased brain size

use of fire

increased cooperation

Q How are we able to date the origin of the KRTHAP1 pseudogene, which contributes to hairlessness in humans?

a selective sweep

the allele is recessive, so mutation-selection balance maintains it in the population at a high frequency

* increased substitution rate of nonsynonymous mutations since the gene was silenced

increased substitution rate of synonymous mutations since the gene was silenced

Q Why do alleles that are deleterious when homozygous but advantageous when heterozygous, such as sickle-cell, tend to increase when they are rare in the population?

genetic drift

* they have a high probability of combining with a gamete that carries the wild-type allele

low frequencies of heterozygotes tend to increase the prevalence of infectious diseases

these are the circumstances under which genetic diversity is low, leading to selective sweeps

mutation-selection balance

Q Why isn't carbon dioxide generally a limiting factor in the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems?

because carbon dioxide isn't needed by plants

because carbon dioxide isn't needed by animals

unlike the mitochondrial genome, it is a haplotype

it is particularly prone to genome duplication

Q Why is menopause evolutionarily interesting?

we wouldn't expect females to care for their offspring

it is a widespread trait, shared by most mammals

it only occurs in modern, developed societies

females stop reproducing because they become senescent

* females give up the opportunity to reproduce, which should lower their fitness

Q Which of the following is the best-supported scientific statement?

our evolutionary history suggests that it is right for males to take more responsibility for family support in modern, developed societies

female foraging activity contributes the majority of calories in modern hunter-gatherer societies

our closest ancestors were solitary hunters and gatherers

* tools and social learning are useful for both hunting and extraction

chimpanzees get most of their food by hunting

Q Which of the following is _not_ an argument for maintaining biodiversity?

it might be our ethical responsibility to preserve species

we don't know what species might be good for in the future

in general diverse communities are more resistant to disturbance

diverse species communities are good for biotourism

* diverse phytoplankton communities are required to drive the biological pump

Q Why don't all garter snakes develop strong resistance to tetrodotoxin, which would allow them to safely consume rough-skinned newts that produce the compound?

mutation rates are insufficient

there hasn't been enough time for them to evolve the trait

all garter snakes do develop strong resistance to tetrodotoxin

a tradeoff with top-down regulation by birds of prey, which eat garter snakes

* The population is too large for random drift to be important

The population is subject to gene flow from a population in a different environment

ANS because they disperse and find new habitat patches

MARK "because they compete better" is worth half marks

Q (2 points) Why do fruit flies with _sitter_ allele of the _for_ gene have high fitness when the population density is low?

Q (3 points) in the lynx-hare experiment, where patches of boreal forest are treated in different ways (control; lynx exclusion by electric fence; provision of extra food for hares; combination [both lynx exclusion and food provision]), what would we conclude if (a) population cycles stopped in both the lynx-exclusion and combination plots but persisted in the control and hare-food plots? (b) population cycles stopped in both the hare-food and combination plots but persisted in the control and lynx-exclusion plots?  (c) persisted in all of the plots (assume that we did not just mess up the experiment)?

ANS (a) the population cycles are driven by top-down, lynx-hare interactions; (b) the cycles are driven by bottom-up, lynx-vegetation interactions; (c) the cycles are driven by something we haven't figured out yet

Q (2 points) in an isolated four-species freshwater food chain (pike eat sunfish which eat zooplankton which eat phytoplankton), what are the expected effects of _decreasing_ the pike population (e.g., by increasing the amount of fishing) on (a) the zooplankton population (b) the phytoplankton population ?

ANS (a) zooplankton decrease, (b) phytoplankton increase

MARK no points for "trophic cascade", that's just a label ...

Q (2 points) Two tree species, A and B, coexist in a temperate forest. Species A has fruit that are eaten by a large herbivore. Hunting drives the herbivore extinct, and the population of species A declines rapidly; the population of species B doesn't change much. What is your best guess about (a) the competitive relationships between A and B, and (b) what was allowing species A to persist in the environment?

J (3 points) You want to conduct an experiment to find out if access to fresh vegetables can help male finches make their beaks orange. You have 40 male finches, some standard finch food (with no fresh vegetables) and some fresh vegetables. Explain specific steps you would take you would take to follow good experimental principles. Divide your answer clearly into 3 sentences; each should explicate a different principle.

ANS The experiment should be _controlled_: we should have one group with access to fresh vegetables, and compare them to a grout with out. The experiment should be _randomized_: we use computer random numbers to assign finches to the treatment (vegetable) or control (no vegetable) group. The experiment should be _replicated_: finches in different groups should differ in nothing but access to vegetables, even random things like cages and feeding times should not differ systematically. The experiment should be _focused_: everything should be kept as similar as possible, for example the food given to both groups should be the same except for the vegetables.

J (2 points) Ground finches with larger beaks can crack more different kinds of seeds than finches with smaller beaks, and do better when food is scarce. Give two likely reasons (separated by commas) why some finches have smaller beaks.

STANS Smaller-beaked finches may: move around more efficiently, reproduce more efficiently, process small seeds more efficiently.
