Q Environments all over the world are changing as a result of global warming. Could this influence natural selection?

No. The environment is always changing. Global warming is nothing new.

No. Existing species from hot environments will simply expand their ranges.

* Yes. Traits associated with reproductive success in warmer environments are likely to increase in frequency.

Yes. Mutation rates are likely to increase, because mutations occur more frequently in hot environments.

Q A blood culture with a population of malaria parasites is exposed to a drug treatment. Researchers notice that some parasites randomly do or do not encounter the drug. The ones that do reproduce well, whereas the ones that don't have two different responses. The majority of parasites die when they encounter the drug. Parasites with one or two copies of the _freeze_ allele stop their reproductive functions when they encounter the drug: their lifespans remain normal, but they never reproduce again. If these parasites are continually exposed to this sort of treatment, we expect that natural selection on the _freeze_ allele:

will occur, because all of the logical conditions are met

will not occur, because there is no variation in traits

will not occur, because variation in traits is not heritable

will not occur, because there is no variation in reproductive success

* will not occur, variation in reproductive success is not related to heritable traits

STARTSA

MARK  Feel free to deduct if answers are long and contain irrelevant or (especially) wrong stuff along with the right stuff.

Q Some researchers want to test whether bright spots on damselfish are related to social hierarchy. They want to compare fish with different patterns by seeing how other damselfish react to them. 

SQ The researchers are debating whether to: manipulate fish appearance with paint; manipulate fish appearance with diet; or choose fish who naturally have more or brighter spots. Assuming all three methods can reliably change fish appearance, suggest a possible \emph{disadvantage} of each method (3 points).

STANS Paint might look funny to other fish, or have metabolic effects on focal fish. Diet might have other effects on the fish besides appearance. Choosing means you have to worry about every possible difference between control and bright fish; this is probably the worst approach. 

MARK One point per category. No need to be strict.

SQ In addition to the points above, list two other points that could help to make this a good experiment (2 points).

STANS \emph{Markers will identify your first two points and mark only those.} Use many focal fish (bright and non-bright). Use many test fish (the ones that whose reactions you check). Carefully control the experiment (for example, feed control and treatment fish in the same way except for the supplement; apply non-bright paint to the control fish). Be careful about replication: don't keep control fish and treatment fish with their own group but separate from each other.

MARK One point per point.

Q A researcher collects 20 peppered moths and finds that 8 are homozygous for the dark allele (D); 8 are homozygous for the light allele (L); and four are heterozygous.

SQ What are the estimated genotype frequencies in this population (2 points)?

STANS DD=8/20 = 0.4; DL = 4/20=0.2; LL=8/20 = 0.4.

MARK The main thing is whether they understand what a genotype frequency is. If they start at the right point, but then continue with a whole bunch of HW nonsense, you can give them one point. I guess. 

SQ The moths homozygous for L are light, where as all the others are dark. 
What type of dominance is seen in the DL allele?
What are the estimated phenotype frequencies for this population (2 points)?

STANS This is complete dominance. The dark allele is dominant. 

MARK Full marks for _either_ or both of these.

STANS Frequencies: Dark = 0.4+0.2 = 0.6. Light = 0.4.

MARK A full mark for clearly understanding what a phenotype frequency is, even if they mess up the dominance or genotypes.

SQ The researchers determine that there are more homozygotes in this population than would be expected from Hardy-Weinberg assumptions. What is a possible biological reason for this (1 point)?

STANS Inbreeding, assortative mixing, barriers to reproduction (pre-zygotic isolation) lack of random mating, poor survival of heterozygotes (post-zygotic isolation), disruptive selection.

ANS \emph{Wrong: } heterozygote advantage, balancing selection

MARK Full marks for any reasonable answer, as long as it's not supplemented by additional nonsense. I now realize that there will be answers I don't like that just refer to deviation (gene flow, selection \ldots). I think half a point for these? Not wrong, but don't indicate understanding.

Q Researchers collect related bacteria from a wheat field (bacterium W), a natural grassland (G), and a natural forest (F) and measure their ability to do certain chemical reactions. The W bacterium is successful at reactions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The G bacterium is successful at 1, 3 and 6. F is successful at 1 and 7.

SQ Under what circumstances or assumptions would you do a phenetic (distance-based) analysis of these data (1 point)?

STANS If we don't have a good basis for knowing which traits are ancestral or derived.

SQ Under what circumstances or assumptions would you do a cladistic (evolution-based) analysis of these data (1 point)?

STANS If we can assume that we know which traits are derived, for example if we believe that the common answer lacked all of these abilities.

SQ Do a phenetic analysis, and draw the most likely tree (2 points).

SANS 14ex We see three differences between F and G, four between W and G, and many between W and F. We therefore draw a tree where F and G are sisters, and W branches off first.

MARK The right phenetic tree is all that's necessary for full marks. 1 point for a \emph{clear} and correct cladistic tree with either explanations or marks. 1 point for a clear phenetic summary of distances but the wrong (or no) tree.

SQ Assume that you learn about the ancestor, do a cladistic analysis, and get a different answer than above, and eventually conclude that your phenetic analysis was wrong. What is a specific, biological reason why the phenetic analysis might have been wrong (1 point)?

STANS The phenetic analysis may have been wrong because one species was under natural selection to develop unique traits. In this example, if all of the traits are assumed to be derived, we would group G with W instead of F. The unique traits in W could be because a wheat field is a newer environment than a forest or a grassland.

MARK Full mark for anything reasonably clear about unique traits. Half mark for being clear that cladistic is a model of how evolution occurred and phenetic is not.
