Luce:

Here are my questions again.  They should be the same as last time,
but I removed some leftover lines at the end, and indicated morning
and evening.

Best,

JD

SA (morning). You are asked to construct a phylogeny that reflects the
evolutionary history of four species. Compared to an outgroup, Species
1 has derived characters A and B. Species 2 has derived characters A,
C, D. Species 3 has derived characters A, C, D, E, F, G. Species 4 has
derived characters A, B and F.

a) What approach should you use to construct this phylogeny? (1 point)

ANS The cladistic approach, using parsimony.

COMMENTS Full credit for cladistic approach, or parsimony, or a
parsimonious explanation of synapomorphies.  Half credit for
synapomorphies without cladistics or parsimony.

b) Which of the traits above will be useful in inferring the
relationship between these four species? (1 point)

ANS B, C, D and F.  A is not informative because all of the taxa have
it.  E and G are not informative in a simple cladistic approach
because only one taxon has them.

COMMENTS Half a point if only one mistake is made (including both E
and G can count as one mistake).

c) What phylogeny would you infer? Hint: simplify by using the answer
from b). (2 points)

ANS ((Drawing)).  Species 2 and 3 are sisters, because they share two
synapomorphies (C and D).  There is no good way to have F evolve only
once, so we make 1 and 4 sisters so that B can evolve only once.

COMMENTS 1 point for 2 and 3 as sister taxa, one point for 1 and 4 as
sister taxa.

SA (morning). To investigate the role of endophytic fungi in plant
ecology, researchers perform a test where they grow forest plants with
and without normal endophytic fungi, and with and without exposure to
normal environmental fungi from the forest. What should they conclude
about the role of endophytic fungi:

a) if both samples with endophytic fungi have lower growth than the
other two? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes are parasitic.

b) if both samples with endophytic fungi have higher growth than the
other two? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes are mutualists.

c) if the sample with only environmental fungi has lower growth than
the other three? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes protect the leaves in some way from the effects of
environmental fungi.

COMMENTS Half a point for saying they are mutualists without
mentioning protection.  Full credit for protection without the word
mutualist.

SA (evening). You are asked to construct a phylogeny that reflects the
evolutionary history of four species. Compared to an outgroup, Species
1 has derived characters A and D. Species 2 has derived characters A,
B, C. Species 4 has derived characters A, B, C, E, F, G. Species 3 has
derived characters A, D and E.

a) What approach should you use to construct this phylogeny? (1 point)

ANS The cladistic approach, using parsimony.

COMMENTS Full credit for cladistic approach, or parsimony, or a
parsimonious explanation of synapomorphies.  Half credit for
synapomorphies without cladistics or parsimony.

b) Which of the traits above will be useful in inferring the
relationship between these four species? (1 point)

ANS B, C, D and E.  A is not informative because all of the taxa have
it.  F and G are not informative in a simple cladistic approach
because only one taxon has them.

COMMENTS Half a point if only one mistake is made (including both F
and G can count as one mistake).

c) What phylogeny would you infer? Hint: simplify by using the answer
from b). (2 points)

ANS ((Drawing)).  Species 2 and 4 are sisters, because they share two
synapomorphies (C and B).  There is no good way to have E evolve only
once, so we make 1 and 3 sisters so that D can evolve only once.

COMMENTS 1 point for 2 and 4 as sister taxa, one point for 1 and 3 as
sister taxa.

SA (evening). Researchers perform a test where they grow forest plants
with and without normal endophytic fungi, and with and without
exposure to normal environmental fungi from the forest. What should
they conclude:

a) if both samples with endophytic fungi have lower growth than the
other two? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes are parasitic.

COMMENTS Half a point for saying "pathogenic" instead.

b) if both samples with environmental fungi have lower growth than the
other two? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes are commensals.

COMMENTS Half a point for saying that the environmental fungi are
parasitic (no extra credit, though).  Death without trial for saying
the endophytes are mutualistic (that's the answer to the morning
question).

c) if the sample with only environmental fungi has lower growth than
the other three? (1 point)

ANS The endophytes protect the leaves in some way from the effects of
environmental fungi.

COMMENTS Half a point for saying they are mutualists without
mentioning protection.  Full credit for protection without the word
mutualist.
