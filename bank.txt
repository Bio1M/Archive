B. Some bacteria survive boiling and grow in the short-necked flasks
* C. Bacteria arrive from the environment and grow in the short-necked flasks, but are blocked from entering the swan-necked flasks
D. Bacteria are adapted to grow in short-necked flasks.

MC.  Assume the experiment above was done carefully and correctly, as described.  What is a possible objection to reaching the conclusion above based only on this experiment?

A. The experimenter may have overheated the flasks
B. The experimenter may not have allowed enough time for spontaneous generation to occur
C. The right kind of bacteria may not be present in the laboratory environment
* D. Spontaneous generation may require free air flow, which may have been blocked by the swan-necked flasks

MC.  Claytonia virginica is a woodland spring herb with flowers that vary from white to pale pink to bright pink. The slugs which damage the plants prefer to eat pink-flowering over white-flowering plants.  The bees that pollinate this plant prefer also prefer pink to white flowers, meaning that Claytonia with pink flowers reproduce more effectively, if they survive the slugs.  A researcher observes that the percentage of different flower colors remains stable in the study population from year to year.

MC. Gazelles being chased by predators sometimes display a behavior called "stotting" -- they stop running and jump straight up into the air.  This slows them down, and seems to increase their chance of being caught.  Which of the following is the _least_ likely explanation of this behavior, based on evolutionary theory?

A. The gazelles are male gazelles trying to show females that they have good genes, so that they will have more mating success
B. The gazelles want to show the predator how fast and athletic they are, so that the predator will give up the chase and the gazelle can get back to eating

After 10 generations of allowing 5 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, they found that 50% of the populations were either all white, or all dark.  What would be expected if they allowed 10 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, for the same time period?

A. About 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

B. Higher average fitness in both populations
C. Increased genetic difference between the two populations
* D. Decreased genetic difference between the two populations
