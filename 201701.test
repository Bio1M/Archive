They are trying to impress female zebras so they can get more mating opportunities

They are willing to risk their lives to protect their offspring

* They are willing to risk their lives to protect the species

Q Researchers raised 100 populations of peppered moths, starting with an equal number of homozygous white and dark individuals in each case.  After 10 generations of allowing 5 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, they found that 50% of the populations were either all white, or all dark.  If this effect is due to genetic drift, what would be expected if they allowed 10 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, for the same time period?

About 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

More than 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

* Less than 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

All of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

Q The small ground finch and the large ground finch share a recent common ancestor (about 250,000 years ago). Small ground finches are much smaller than large ground finches, but evidence shows that neither species has changed much in size in the last few thousand years. This is probably an example of:

* reinforcement; disruptive

Q Which of the following is _not_ a mechanism that makes species divergence _less_ likely in sympatry than in allopatry?

More gene flow in sympatry

More competition in sympatry

Different environments in allopatry lead to differences in selection

* Reinforcement is more likely in sympatry

None of these are appropriate mechanisms; they could all be correct answers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q European humans are descended about 98% from early modern humans, which evolved in Africa, and about 2% from Neanderthal populations that lived in Europe at that time. We might think that sexual competition between males was one of the ways that modern humans displaced Neanderthals, if modern European human populations:

* shared more mitochondrial DNA than nuclear DNA with Neanderthal populations

shared less mitochondrial DNA than nuclear DNA with Neanderthal populations

showed more sexual dimorphism than African populations

showed less sexual dimorphism than African populations


Q  Two hypothetical species of songbirds, A and B, overwinter together in
mixed flocks in northern South America. In spring, species A goes to the east
coast of North America, and species B goes to the west coast.  Breeding takes
place in North America in the spring and summer. What can you say about the
isolating mechanisms of these two species?

They must have different courtship patterns.

They must have a post-zygotic isolating mechanism.

* The two species are reproductively isolated by allopatry.

The two species are reproductively isolated by genetic incompatibility.

Reinforcement must be occurring when they winter together.

geographic isolation

niche differences

* gene flow

Q If we believe in using monophyletic groups when possible, why should we object to _How Humans Evolved_ referring to therapsids as reptiles? 

Therapsids were more similar to mammals than to reptiles

Therapsids were more similar to dinosaurs than to reptiles

Real reptiles had not yet evolved at the time of the therapsids

* If therapsids are reptiles, then mammals would have to be reptiles, too

Q Which of the following is _not_ a likely reason for early primates developing stereoscopic vision?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q Why do researchers include information about mice when comparing
humans and chimpanzees to understand human evolution?

We first need to understand how chimpanzees evolved from mice,
before we can understand how humans evolved from chimpanzees

By replicating our comparisons, we reduce the possibility that our
findings are due to chance

* The mice serve as an outgroup, indicating which traits are more
likely to be basal

The mice serve as a control group, so that conditions for the
humans and chimpanzees can be as similar as possible

Q Why are shared, derived characters better evidence of evolutionary
relatedness than shared, basal characters?

Because basal characters are also shared by the outgroup

* Because no evolutionary changes are required to explain the presence of basal characters

Because basal characters cannot be measured as reliably as derived characters

Because the presence of basal characters is not due to convergent evolution

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q The fossil record is relatively rich in organisms that lived in shallow water or mud, as opposed to the open ocean, or land.  This is likely primarily due to:

Taxonomic bias

* Habitat bias

Diversity bias

Abundance bias

Temporal bias

COMMENT Use this information for the next two questions, and answer assuming the phylogeny in the figure is correct. Ratites are large, flightless birds (cassowaries, emus, rheas and ostriches).  They are closely related to tinamous, which are flying birds.  In the last few years, new research has changed what we know about ratite evolution, suggesting it occurred as shown in the figure below. 

FIG ratites.png

Q Based on this tree:

Ratites and tinamous are both monophyletic groups

Ratites are a monophyletic group, but tinamous are not

* Tinamous are a monophyletic group, but ratites are not

Neither ratites nor tinamous are monophyletic

Q Assuming ratites had an ancestor which could fly:

Flight must have been lost more than once during the evolution of ratites

Flight must have been regained by an ancestor of the tinamous

Both A and B must be true

* Either A or B must be true, but we can't tell which one

STARTSA

Q A researcher wants to test the effects of a vitamin-enhanced diet on mice. The researcher puts 4 mice each in six different cages. Three of the cages are supplied with a regular diet, and three with an enhanced diet.

SQ Why does the researcher give some mice a regular diet, if the purpose is to test the enhanced diet? How will the results from the group with a regular diet be used (2 points)?

ASPACE 5ex

MARK  Feel free to deduct if answers are long and contain irrelevant or (especially) wrong stuff along with the right stuff.

ANS The mice with a regular diet are a control group. Their results will be used to make sure the mice are progressing as expected without vitamins, and to compare with the results from the treatment group.

RUB One point for control group. One point for comparison.

MARK The key is comparison. If they are clear about that, two points. Any combination of other good ideas above, without the idea of comparison, is one point.

SQ How many independent replicates are there in each of the experimental groups (i.e., control and treatment)? Explain your answer (2 points).

ANS Mice in a single cage should not be considered as independent. They share something with each other (the cage) which is not the experimental variable and which they don't share with other mice. The cages here are the experimental replicates. There are three in each group, or six total.

RUB One point for the idea that replicates are cages and not mice. One point for the correct answer.

ASPACE 4ex

Q You are asked to construct a phylogeny that reflects the
evolutionary history of four species. Compared to a known outgroup, Species 1 has derived characters A and B. Species 2 has derived characters A, F, G. Species 3 has derived characters A, B and E. Species 4 has derived characters A, C, D, E, F, G.

SQ What approach should you use to construct this phylogeny? (1 point)

ASPACE 4ex

ANS The cladistic approach.

SQ What feature of the data led you to choose this approach? (1 point)

ANS We have information about derived traits, so we can use a cladistic approach. We use the cladistic approach when we can because it is better than the phenetic approach.

RUB The relevant feature of the data is that we have information about derived traits.

MARK The superiority of the cladistic approach is not a feature of the data. Points for being clear about ``derived traits", ``comparing to the outgroup", or ``synapomorphies".

MARK Half a mark for saying that they use phenetic because they can't use cladistic for some reason. In general, try not to deduct twice for the same mistake (but here, they really have to get at least something wrong to explain phenetic).

ASPACE 5ex 

SQ Which of the traits above will _not_ be useful in inferring the
relationship between these four species? (1 point)

ANS A is not useful because all of the four species have it. C and D are not useful on a cladistic tree because only one species has them.

RUB Half mark for each set. No deduction for saying E is not useful (it doesn't _turn out_ to be useful).

MARK  Explanation is not required (but nonsense can be punished). Full marks for just A for phenetic people.

ASPACE 5ex

SQ Draw a tree to show what phylogeny you would infer from these data.
 Hint: simplify by using the answer from c). You don't need to mark traits on the tree. (2 points)

ANS We first group 2 and 4, because they share two synapomorphies (F and G, if we ignore A). 3 shares a relevant synapomorphy (B) with 1. It doesn't share any synapomorphies with the _group_ 2 and 4, so we group it with 1.

AFIG tree.Rout.pdf

RUB One point for correctly grouping 2 and 4. Second point if the whole tree is right. No points or deductions for traits or outgroups.

Q Red-yellow birds have R and Y alleles at a locus that determines their color. Birds with RR are red, birds with YY are yellow and birds with RY are orange?  Researchers study a particular population and find 15 red birds, 30 orange birds and 5 yellow birds.

SQ What type of dominance is seen in the R allele (1 point)?

ASPACE 5ex

ANS Co-dominance. Incomplete dominance or neither allele dominant also acceptable.

SQ What are the _genotype_ frequencies of the birds in this population (1 point)?

ANS 15/50, 30/50, 5/50. Equivalently 30%, 60%, 10%.

RUB Full marks for correct answer, otherwise half a point for clear, correct work. 

MARK Or 0.3, 0.6, 0.1. 

ASPACE 10ex

SQ What are the _allele_ frequencies of the birds in this population (2 points)?

ANS There are 2*15+30 = 60 R alleles and 30+2*5=40 Y alleles, so the frequencies are 0.6 and 0.4.

RUB Full marks for correct answer, otherwise 1 point for clear, correct work. 

ASPACE 10ex

SQ What are the Hardy-Weinberg _expected_ genotype frequencies for these allele frequencies (2 points)?

ANS The expected frequencies are $RR: p^2=0.36$, $RY: 2pq = 0.48$, $YY: q^2=0.16$.

RUB Full marks for correct answer, otherwise 1 point for clear, correct work. 

MARK Full marks here for a correct calculation from the wrong starting point, but only if they are specified clearly in part b, and if they add up to 1.
