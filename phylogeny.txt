You are studying a new clade, and identify three derived traits: flight, blueness and singing.  Species A is blue (only).  Species B flies and sings.  Species C is blue, flies and sings.

a) Make three separate, labeled trees showing the phylogenetic relationship between A, B and C that you would infer if you looked only at one trait at a time. 

KEY Tree labeled “blue” should group A and C. Trees labeled “flies” and “sings” should group B and C.

b) Based on all the data above, what is your best guess for the correct phylogenetic tree, and why? 

KEY A tree grouping B and C (matching the "flies" or "sings" tree above),  because this provides the most parsimonious explanation of how the traits could have evolved.

c) Which of the trees from part a) differs from the one in part b)? 

KEY The one for blueness
