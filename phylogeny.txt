MC. You are given data from a DNA hybridization study on a group of bacteria.  This data indicates how similar the DNA of each type is to that of each other type, but not what the differences are.  What kind of phylogenetic analysis could you do on these data?

*A. Phenetic analysis
B. Cladistic analysis
C. Parsimony analysis
D. Either A or B
E. No phylogenetic analysis can be done

MC.  Your professor wants you to construct a phylogenetic tree of orchids. She gives you tissue from seven orchid species and one lily. What is the most likely reason she gave you the lily?

* A. To serve as an out-group
B. To see if it's an unrecognized species of orchid
C. To see if the lily and the orchids show all the same shared derived characters (synapomorphies)
D. To see if you were paying attention

(primates figure)

MC. Which of the groups of taxa identified on this tree is _not_ monophyletic?

A. Self-important primates (SIPs)
B. Hominids
C. Chimpanzees
* D. Apes
E. Gorillas

MC. According to the figure above, which of the following groups is _not_ a clade?

A. Hominids
B. Chimpanzees
*C. Apes
D. Gorillas
E. Australopithecus

MC. According to the figure above, which of the following is _not_ a pair of sister taxa?

A. SIPs (self-important primates) and gorillas
B. Chimpanzees and hominids
C. Chimps and bonobos
*D. Chimpanzees and gorillas
E. Humans and Australopithecus

MC. You find a new fossil deposit with many red algal species, but no green plant species.  What would you conclude?

A. There were no plant species present at this time and location
B. Conditions were not right to fossilize plant species at this time and location
C. There was a mass extinction event among plant species at this time and location
*D. Either A or B
E. Either B or C

MC. Which of the following statements best describes the use of the principle of parsimony in constructing phylogenetic trees?

A. We use the tree that best reflects the molecular clock
*B. We use the simplest tree that describes observed patterns
C. We use synapomorphies to identify related species
D. We use an outgroup to root the tree
E. We use parsimony to calculate the likelihood of the tree

SA (morning). You are asked to construct a phylogeny that reflects the
evolutionary history of four species. Compared to an outgroup, Species
1 has derived characters A and B. Species 2 has derived characters A,
C, D. Species 3 has derived characters A, C, D, E, F, G. Species 4 has
derived characters A, B and F.

a) What approach should you use to construct this phylogeny? (1 point)

ANS The cladistic approach, using parsimony.

COMMENTS Full credit for cladistic approach, or parsimony, or a
parsimonious explanation of synapomorphies.  Half credit for
synapomorphies without cladistics or parsimony.

b) Which of the traits above will be useful in inferring the
relationship between these four species? (1 point)

ANS B, C, D and F.  A is not informative because all of the taxa have
it.  E and G are not informative in a simple cladistic approach
because only one taxon has them.

COMMENTS Half a point if only one mistake is made (including both E
and G can count as one mistake).

c) What phylogeny would you infer? Hint: simplify by using the answer
from b). (2 points)

ANS ((Drawing)).  Species 2 and 3 are sisters, because they share two
synapomorphies (C and D).  There is no good way to have F evolve only
once, so we make 1 and 4 sisters so that B can evolve only once.

COMMENTS 1 point for 2 and 3 as sister taxa, one point for 1 and 4 as
sister taxa.
