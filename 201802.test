J Slash pine is a tree that lives in swampy areas, and is closely related to shortleaf pine, which lives on higher, drier ground. In a particular area, shortleaf pine fossil remnants are up to 20,000 years old, while slash pine fossil remnants are only up to 5000 years old. Which of the following is the _least_ likely explanation for this?

Shortleaf pine was the first to arrive in the area

* Shortleaf pine is more likely to fossilize than slash pine because of its habitat

Shortleaf pine is more likely to fossilize than slash pine because it has harder cones

Shortleaf pine is historically more abundant than slash pine

J Which of these is _not_ a reason why scientists' trees are imperfect models of how evolution occured?

Genetic information can be transferred between organisms

Sex can combine genes from different organisms

* Mutation can produce new alleles

Scientists may not have enough information to make the best trees

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J Fossil evidence indicates that hominin brains probably got larger, then smaller, then larger again. This provides evidence _against_:

Inheritance of acquired characteristics

* Goal-directed evolution

Adaptation

Acclimation

Vestigial traits

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J Long-billed hummingbirds feeding on long, tubular flowers provides evidence for:

Goal-directed evolution

* Co-evolution

Convergent evolution

Radiation and contraction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J Primates are an order characterized by
	highly developed stereroscopic vision;
	versatile limbs; and
	large brains. 
Which of the following is _least_ likely to have contributed to these adaptations in early primates?

Climbing and balancing on trees

Leaping from branch to branch

* Hanging from branches

Exploiting new plant resources

Catching insects

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J Bonobos swing through trees. Their close relatives humans and gorillas do not. Does this provide evidence that humans are closer to gorillas than to bonobos?

No. Humans are closer to bonobos.

Yes. It provides _some_ evidence, even if that's not the final answer.

* It provides evidence only if the relevant common ancestor could swing through trees

It provides evidence only if the relevant common ancestor could _not_ swing through trees

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J The large amount of detailed splitting on the hominin tree 
	(Hominidae, Hominininae, Hominini, Hominina ...)
is most likely due to:

The fact that hominins evolved more than other species

The fact that hominins change their environment more than other species

The fact that hominins went through several cycles of radiation and contraction

* Observer bias

Goal-directed evolution

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J According to the class material, how do scientists know that our hominin ancestors had less sexual dimorphism in tooth size than chimpanzees do?

* The overall distribution of adult tooth sizes in our hominin ancestors is not bimodal

Tooth experts can tell the difference between fossil male and female teeth

Skeleton experts can associate fossil teeth with skeletal hip bones

Our hominin ancestors were closely related to us, and we don't have much sexual dimorphism in tooth size

----------------------------------------------------------------------

J If a group of hominin ancestors showed very slow development (long childhoods), this provides evidence that they:

* Were highly social

Obtained most of their calories from meat

Obtained most of their calories from plants

Walked upright

----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT Choose the strongest accurate answer

J Polyploidy is an important mechanism for diversification because it

Increases gene flow

Both increases gene flow and provides material for new genetic innovation

Decreases gene flow

* Both decreases gene flow and provides material for new genetic innovation

Q What can we infer if a gene has accumulated a large number of nonsynonymous substitutions, relative to the number of synonymous substitutions, over the course of evolution (i.e., the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio is greater than expected)?

The gene is probably the cause of a genetic disease

The mutation rate is unusually high

* Changes in the phenotype coded by the gene are adaptive, or beneficial (i.e., the gene is the target of positive selection)

Variability in the phenotype coded by the gene is maladaptive, or deleterious

The gene is the target of purifying selection

Q The fact that phenylketonuria does not cause harmful phenotypic effects if an affected person eats a diet that is very low in phenylalanine is an example of:

* gene-by-environment interaction

genetic drift

mutation-selection balance

heterozygote advantage

balancing selection

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q Which of the following can genetic data _not_ give us information about?

* Use of tools by hominins in the past

How long ago a deleterious mutation occurred in the population

Occurrence of positive selection in the past

Occurrence of purifying selection in the past

Population bottlenecks

Q Which one of the following statements is false?

Use of tools broadens the availability of food resources

* Homo sapiens is the only hominin to have used stone tools

A wide variety of mammals and birds have been observed to use tools

Tools may have been used by humans as part of a scavenging strategy

Use of tools is limited to terrestrial animals

Q Which of the following statements is true in general of modern hunter/gatherer societies?

Most of the calories are obtained by women's foraging activities

Meat makes up more than 99% of the diet

* Men's foraging activities (mostly hunting) bring in the majority of the calories

People become experts in complex foraging at an early age

Cooperative activities and food sharing rarely occur

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q What (according to Prof. Bolker) is wrong with the statement, ``because males collected the majority of the calories in the environment of evolutionary adaptation (EAA), they are better adapted to foraging and should be responsible for being wage-earners in modern society, while females should be primarily responsible for child care''?

Males and females should have similar, not different, roles in a modern society

Males did not collect the majority of calories in the EAA

Child care was shared between males and females in the EAA

* Science should not be used to make normative statements

Nothing; the statement is actually correct

Q How does cultural evolution work?

Behavioural traits are transmitted by social learning from individuals in one generation to other individuals within the same generation (e.g., among siblings or among similarly aged individuals in a social group)

* Behavioural traits are transmitted by social learning from individuals in one generation to individuals in the next generation (e.g., from parents to offspring)

Individuals inherit tools from their parents

Behavioural traits are coded in the genome, so they can evolve across generations

Material objects that are created by organisms are coded in the genome as part of the _extended phenotype_

Q What does reduced genetic variation in human populations outside of Africa tell us about the history of human migration and evolution?

evolutionary rates decreased after humans left Africa

populations that stayed in Africa experienced stronger selection pressures from infectious diseases

populations that stayed in Africa experienced weaker selection pressures from infectious diseases

* populations that left Africa experienced population bottlenecks

populations that left Africa experienced lower rates of deleterious mutation

Q Why are mitochondrial genomes useful for understanding human evolution?

Relatively rapid evolution makes them good for detecting recent evolutionary events

They can be used to reconstruct the history of past population sizes

We can use them to reconstruct gene trees and find the date of the most recent common ancestor

Because they are maternally inherited, they can help distinguish female and male migratory patterns

* All of the above

Q Which of the following regions was the _last_ to be colonized by modern humans?

Africa

* North and South America

Australia

Europe

Asia

Q How do we know that modern humans interbred with other recent human species such as Neanderthals and Denisovans?

fossils of all three species have been found at the same archaeological sites

all three species are known to have used stone tools

phylogenetic analysis of louse DNA shows that some louse species migrated among these three species

Neanderthals are more morphologically similar to humans in areas where the species overlapped

* Haplotypes of Neanderthal and Denisovan origin can be found in the human nuclear genome

Q What phylogenetic pattern tells us that genetic introgression has occurred across species?

Gene trees show evidence of lots of very recent branching

Gene trees show evidence of lots of very ancient branching

* The shape of the phylogeny for particular genes is qualitatively different from the overall phylogenetic pattern of the different species

Mitochondrial genomes differ across species

The same genetic code is used by all extant species

Q Which of the following statements about human migration is true? (Note: ``Homo sapiens" does _not_ include Neanderthals and Denisovans)

We are sure that the only time that Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa was around 60 kya

* The signature of migration bottlenecks can be seen in modern geographic patterns of genetic diversity

Homo sapiens went extinct in Africa, only to recolonize Africa later

All other hominin species went extinct before Homo sapiens evolved

Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa about 1 mya


Q Which of the following statements about Mendelian and quantitative traits is _false_?

Mendelian traits follow simpler rules of heredity than quantitative traits

Quantitative traits are more affected by environmental variation than Mendelian traits are

* Only quantitative traits are subject to gene-by-environment interactions (GxE)

Mendelian traits are typically either dominant, recessive, or overdominant

Quantitative traits are affected by genetic variation at many loci

Q Why do we think that lactase persistence coevolved with the cultural practice of raising dairy cattle?

Because it evolved by genetic drift

Because it evolved due to heterozygote advantage

Because the practice of raising dairy cattle could have spread through social facilitation

* Because lactase persistence doesn't have a selective advantage without access to non-human milk

Because we can detect selective sweeps in the region of the genome surrounding the loci that control lactase persistence

Q What would you expect to happen to the frequency of sickle-cell allele in a population (in the long term) if an effective mosquito control program were implemented, preventing the transmission of malaria?

Increase, because the advantage of being heterozygous for the sickle-cell allele disappears

* Decrease, because the advantage of being heterozygous for the sickle-cell allele disappears

Decrease, because the disadvantage of being homozygous for the sickle-cell allele disappears

Stay the same

It depends on whether or not genetic counseling is offered to allow carriers to choose alternative reproductive options (adoption or gamete donation)

Q What are the potential impacts of a point mutation that affects the genome outside of any coding region?

It must be neutral, because it doesn't affect the biochemical structure of a protein

It could lead to changes in copy number

* It could lead to regulatory changes, changing the timing and amount of proteins produced

It is a synonymous substitution, so it will have no effect on the phenotype

It will change the type of RNA that is produced from the nearest coding sequence

Q Why are alleles that cause disease when they are homozygous (deleterious recessive alleles) generally found at higher frequencies in the population than alleles that cause disease when they are homozygous or heterozygous (deleterious dominant alleles)?

Because recessive alleles cause milder forms of disease than dominant alleles

Because of mutation-selection balance

Because of genetic drift

Because of purifying selection

* Because heterozygotes can carry a single deleterious allele without incurring selective disadvantage


Q When considering selective pressures in the evolution of human skin colour, why is skin cancer not considered a very good candidate?

Because skin cancer rates don’t vary with latitude

Because having more melanin/darker skin doesn’t have a protective effect against skin cancer

Because having more melanin/darker skin will lower mutation rates, leading to a slower rate of evolution

* Because deaths due to skin cancer occur too late in life to prevent reproduction

Because skin colour probably did not evolve due to sexual selection, as Charles Darwin speculated

Q Which of the following are advantages and/or disadvantages of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)?

GWAS can only be used to provide information about Mendelian traits

GWAS provide evidence of positive selection by locating regions of the genome with unusually low levels of within-population variation

* GWAS can detect genetic markers, and thus regions of the genome, that are associated with quantitative traits

GWAS are more powerful than twin studies for quantifying the overall level of genetic variation in a trait

GWAS can often be used to pinpoint the precise locations of the genes underlying a trait

STARTSA

Q (4 points) Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a deleterious recessive Mendelian trait. The median lifespan of people with the disease (homozygotes) is currently about 45 years (i.e. 50% die before age 45). 

SQ What would we expect to happen to the frequency of the CF allele (in newborns) if we discovered a drug that completely mitigates the symptoms of CF (i.e. homozygotes who take the drug are perfectly healthy)?

STANS  CF allele should increase in the population

SQ Why?  

STANS  because there is no longer selection against the homozygotes

SQ Would the change in the allele frequency be different if instead of making homozygotes healthy, the drug instead kept them healthy until age 65, at which point they all died? 

STANS No. We would see the same increase as in part a).

SQ Why?

STANS  people that old aren’t having kids anyway, so their deaths are not evolutionarily relevant

MARK 1 point per subquestion. (a), "Increase" is the keyword. (b) “it is no longer deleterious” is also acceptable; full credit for the right answer even if they don't explicitly mention homozygotes (c) Full marks for either of these sentences (or any clear indicator that the answer is the same as part a. (d) “no selection against the allele” is also acceptable.

Q (2 points) Where in the genome do synonymous mutations occur, and why are they selectively neutral?

STANS in the protein-coding regions of genes; because they don’t lead to a change in the amino acid sequence. 

MARK 1 point per sub-question.  “coding region” is good enough for part 1. “no change in the protein” is OK for part 2; ``doesn't change phenotype'' also acceptable; ``silent'' does not explain anything (don't add or deduct).

Q (2 points) We have evidence of fire in human-inhabited caves (where it must have been deliberately set rather than naturally occurring) dating back to 1 million years ago. Why do we think that humans must have been using fire _earlier_ than 1 million years ago?

STANS  because this is only the earliest evidence we’ve found; there are almost certainly earlier fires that we just haven’t found.

MARK Full marks for either part. No points for any crazy explanations without checking with Ben first.

Q (1 point) What are the differences in tool use between humans and other animals?

STANS humans make and use more complex tools 

MARK “humans are the only animals that we know of that use stone tools” is also OK; keywords are “more complex” or “stone tools”

Q (1 point) Why is the lactase persistence allele only beneficial in human cultures that raise dairy cattle?

STANS because the ability to digest lactose later in life is only useful if you have access to non-human milk

MARK need to make the connection between advantage of lactase/ability to digest and availability of milk

J (2 points) What are two likely triggers for adaptive radiations?

STANS Change in the environment, change in the ecosystem, morphological innovation, new body plans, co-evolution, adaptations that make opportunities for further adaptations, arrival in a new ecological context.

MARK Only mark the first two things they write. Deduct for wrong things combined with right things.

J (1 point) What is a likely reason that hominin species contracted after radiating?

STANS They were out-competed by other hominins (either H. erectus, or us)

MARK I can't really think of anything else, but we should discuss. Half point for things that are obviously reasonable but unsupported (climate change, disease, ecological

J (2 points) Give two different examples of things scientists learn about our ancestors from teeth.

STANS The amount of sexual dimorphism, the diet they were adapted to eat; how quickly they developed

MARK Only mark the first two things they write. Deduct for wrong things combined with right things. Crazy things that are obviously right, e.g., extract DNA and \ldots\ can get full marks.
